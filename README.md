# PokemonAPI

### Test application

I have to make an application that uses this API ([PokemonAPI](https://pokeapi.co/))

Tasks:
- [ ] Show pokemons list
- [ ] Get images for pokemons from Google search (take first image)
- [ ] Create some filters
- [ ] Open pokemon for detail info (also show skills and sprites)
- [ ] Implement adding pokemon locally (with image, skills and sprites)
- [ ] Toggle between local and internet pokemons

Architectural tasks:
- View create via constraints (view separately from controller)
- MVVM
  - (Will be a plus) RxSwift
- Network and database layers separately
  - (Will be a plus) Dependency Injection
